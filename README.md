- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wiktorkub1
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ but I also plan to improve Python in the near future. I've recently purchased an Arduino kit, and I am going to widen 
my knowledge in programming microcontrollers.

Currently reading:
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
- C++ 17 STL Cookbook by Jacek Galowicz
