Hi, I’m @wiktorkub1
I’m currently programming in C/C++ but in the near future I also plan to improve Python with emphasis on Machine Learning/AI which I find very interesting.

Currently reading:
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
- C++ 17 STL Cookbook by Jacek Galowicz
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron
